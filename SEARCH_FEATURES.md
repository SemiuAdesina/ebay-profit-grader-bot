# eBay Profit Grader Bot - New Search Features

## 🎯 Overview

The eBay Profit Grader Bot now includes comprehensive search functionality that allows users to search for both **active** and **sold** eBay listings from a single interface. This addresses the client's question about getting sold listings the same way as active ones.

## ✅ What's New

### 1. Combined Search Interface
- **Single search box** for keywords
- **Three search options**:
  - Search Active Listings (Browse API)
  - Search Sold Listings (Finding API)
  - Search Both (Active + Sold) - **NEW!**

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- `/api/active` - Get active listings only
- `/api/sold` - Get sold listings only  
- `/api/searchAll` - Get both active and sold listings in parallel

### 3. Frontend Features
- Modern, responsive UI with separate sections
- Real-time search results with loading states
- Count badges showing number of active vs sold items
- Clickable links to eBay listings
- Error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 How It Works

### API Architecture
```
Frontend → Server → eBay APIs
    ↓         ↓         ↓
  Search   /api/searchAll  Browse API (Active)
  Button   /api/active     Finding API (Sold)
    ↓         ↓         ↓
  Results   Parallel     Real eBay Data
```

### Data Flow
1. **User enters keywords** in the search box
2. **Clicks "Search Both"** button
3. **Server calls both APIs** in parallel:
   - Browse API for active listings (OAuth)
   - Finding API for sold listings (App ID)
4. **Results are combined** and sent back
5. **Frontend displays** both sections side-by-side

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Combined Search
```javascript
POST /api/searchAll
{
  "keywords": "vintage camera",
  "limit": 10
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "active": [...],      // Active listings
  "sold": [...],        // Sold listings  
  "activeCount": 5,
  "soldCount": 3
}
```

### Individual Searches
```javascript
POST /api/active
POST /api/sold
{
  "keywords": "iPhone 12",
  "limit": 10
}
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Search Section
- Clean, modern design with gradient buttons
- Color-coded buttons:
  - 🟢 Green: Active listings
  - 🔴 Red: Sold listings  
  - 🔵 Blue: Combined search

### Results Display
- **Two-column layout** for combined results
- **Count badges** showing totals
- **Scrollable lists** for long results
- **Hover effects** and smooth animations
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

### Item Details
Each listing shows:
- Title with clickable link to eBay
- Price in green
- Condition information
- End date (for active) or sold date (for sold)
- Direct link to eBay listing

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Test the Features
1. **Start the server**: `node server.js`
2. **Open browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Try these searches**:
   - "book" (works well in sandbox)
   - "camera" 
   - "iPhone"
   - "vintage"

### Sandbox vs Production
- **Sandbox mode**: Use for unlimited testing with fake data
- **Production mode**: Real data but with API quotas
- **Toggle in .env**: `USE_SANDBOX=true/false`

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### Server-Side (server.js)
```javascript
// Combined search endpoint
app.post('/api/searchAll', async (req, res) => {
  const [activeItems, soldItems] = await Promise.all([
    searchActiveItemsBrowseAPI(keywords, limit),
    getCompletedListings(keywords, limit)
  ]);
  res.json({ active: activeItems, sold: soldItems });
});
```

### Frontend (main.js)
```javascript
async function searchBoth() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/searchAll', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ keywords, limit: 10 })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  displaySearchResults(data, data.activeCount, data.soldCount);
}
```

## ✅ Benefits

### For Users
- **One search** shows both active and sold
- **Complete market picture** for better decisions
- **Easy comparison** of current vs sold prices
- **Professional interface** with modern design

### For Developers
- **Modular API design** - use endpoints separately
- **Error handling** with fallbacks
- **Rate limit management** with parallel requests
- **Extensible architecture** for future features

## 🎯 Answer to Client Question

> "Can you get sold listings the same way as active ones with Browse API on the frontend?"

**Answer: No, but we've built a better solution!**

- ❌ Browse API only does active listings
- ✅ Finding API does sold listings (server-side only)
- ✅ **Our solution**: Combined interface that calls both APIs
- ✅ **Result**: Users see both active AND sold from one search

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The implementation is complete and tested. Users can now:

1. **Search active listings** (Browse API)
2. **Search sold listings** (Finding API) 
3. **Search both together** (Combined API)
4. **Compare prices** between active and sold
5. **Make informed decisions** with complete market data

The system handles API errors gracefully, provides loading states, and offers a professional user experience that addresses the client's exact needs.
